# Data Cleaning
Steps I am taking to clean the data:
- First, I look at the distribution of each dataset visually (histograms for all columns)
- I will look to see whether data is normally distributed or skewed
- Replace 0's with NaN's where appropriate
- I replace NaN's with the mean for normal distributions. 
- I replace NaN's with the mode for skewed distributions. 
- This method is called imputing the data. Deletion is also an available tool for cleaning data.
